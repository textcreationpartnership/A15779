            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>ROM the ſame fire the ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher match and the white taper draw two ſundry flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: the one yeelding a ſweet ſauour, the other a ſtinking ſent: the one in colour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the brightneſſe of heauen, the other in ſhew the darknes of hell: the one aſcending with milde and calme motion, declaring the aeriall and vniforme ſubstance, the other ſtill frying &amp; bubling expreſſeth the terreſtriall nature and violent mixture. From the ſame Scriptures Catholikes and Heretikes drawe diuers lights: the Catholike cleere, bright, worthy of God, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to man, agreeable with the Text, conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Fathers, anſwerable to antiquitie. The Heretikes, darke expoſitions, forced interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, racked ſences, ſtinking of pride, breathing ſenſualitie, diſſenting from the Primitiue Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours, ſwaruing from eccleſiaſticall traditions, repugning to Chriſts church the pillar of truth. This diuerſitie proceedeth not from the word of God, which is moſt holy, and lieth alike open to them both, but from the Interpreters diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. As in the aforeſaide example, thoſe vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb facs="tcp:11855:3"/> lights of the taper and match were not cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the fire, but by their owne qualities and temper. For the Catholike commeth with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, the Heretike with arrogancie: the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike with ſubmiſſion to the leaders of Chriſts flocke, the heretike with preſumption of his own conceit: the Catholike armed with conſent of Fathers, the heretike with his owne ſingularity: the Catholike truſting in God, and hoping in his grace, the Heretike relying wholly, eyther vpon the forces of his feeble wit, or beguiled with the illuſions of Lucifer. The which difference, thogh in al controuerſies of religion now called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, it appeereth manifeſtly (to all thoſe who wil examine them to the botome, and wade into the depth: where they ſhal find no other grounds of hereſie, than Chimericall interpretations, and ſelfe-willed expoſitions of the Scriptures) yet in none ſo much as about the bleſſed Sacrament. The Catholikes from theſe foure wordes,</hi> Hoc eſt corpus meum, <hi>deduce their dreadfull, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerent, maieſticall, and deified ſacrifice, the light of Paradice, the foode of Angells. The Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes their common-table Communion, their prophane ſupper, their ſchiſmaticall cup, their tipicall bread, their vnbleſſed breakefaſt. Yet as the taper receiueth often light from the ſtinking match, ſo the wiſedom of God by his infinit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
<pb facs="tcp:11855:3"/> hath ſo permitted theſe hereticall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions in his church: that by occaſion of them the verities of the Catholike religion ſhine nowe as cleare as the Sun at noonetide in the beuty of brightnes. For how many worthy Volumes haue bin penned thereupou moſt learnedly, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſhould neuer haue ſene light? what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion hath this antiperiſtaſis or enuironing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion wrought in the hearts of Catholikes? for by infallible recordes it may be prooued, that for a hundred that were accuſtomed to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate weekely in great citties, now there are well nie ten thouſand. Againe, ſince the Euchariſt hath beene ſo impiouſly blaſphemed of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie, how gloriouſly, how religiouſly, howe maieſtically hath it beene conſecrated vpon the altare, reſerued in the tabernacle, caried in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, in reſpect of former ages? what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>courſe haue we ſeene of Catholiques to the church to worſhip it? what feruour in praying to it? what learned Sermons in exalting it? what zeale to defend it? and not without cauſe: for ſo great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence the maieſtie of God required, his loue deſerued, our homage enforced, ſo many graces thereby receiued, exacted, ſo that hereſie hath rubd off the ruſt of ignorance from many catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, it hath burned the chaffe of imperfections, and purified the corne of deuotion, it hath blown</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:11855:4"/> 
               <hi>off the aſhes of remiſſenes, and reuiued the coles of ſeruour and charitie. Finally, it hath diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the cloudes of ſome irreuerence, and cauſed the bleſſed euchariſt ſhine like a ſpirituall ſunne in the Catholike church. If ſaint Gregory called the ſin of Adam</hi> Foelix culpa, <hi>a happy offence, that deſerued ſuch a Redeemer, I may ſay hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py hereſie that cauſed ſuch reformation: nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther curſed hereſie, and bleſſed prouidence of God, in ordaining ſo inordinate a thing to ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate and noble an end. Wherefore ſince al ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, either by deuotion, or religious almes, or frequent communion, or dayly reuerence, or ardent affects, or learned bookes endeuoure to oppoſe themſelues againſt the enimies of this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, I thought good to caſt my two Mites in</hi> Gazophylacium, <hi>that they with whome I</hi>

The title perhappes wil ſeeme ſomewhat ſtale, but I hope the maner of explicating to be new: or at leaſt, that which lieth ſcattred abroad in Fathers &amp; Doctors, here they ſhall find vnited in one.

               <hi>maieſticall and diuine opinion of the wiſedome and prouidence of God in inſtituting this ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For by vnderſtanding how agreeable it was with all his attributes, how glorious for his church, how conuenient for man, how profitable to all members of his elected congregation, I could not but cry out with Dauid &amp; ſay,</hi> quam magnificata ſunt opera tua Domine! Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia <note place="margin">Pſal. 103.</note> in ſapientia feciſti: impleta eſt terra poſſeſsione tua: <hi>How glorious are thy workes O Lord! thou haſt made al things in wiſedome: the earth is filled with thy riches. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I haue tried by experience, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faith and reaſon, grace and nature, conſort together they make a ſweet harmonie: that is, when rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon applieth the myſteries of our faith to the wit by ſhewing them credible, and worthy to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, then faith flouriſheth exceedingly, and can hardly be remoued: as when an excellent eie meeteth with the cleare light of the ſunne, howe farre, how ſharply, and how distinctly will it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne euen very aereall vapours, and almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible moates. Of ſuch a man ſpake the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet when he deſcribed the happy man, who did me ditate in the lawe of God night and day, that</hi> folium eius non defluet, <hi>his leafe ſhal not fal, becauſe long meditation vppon the myſteries of</hi>

               <hi>Faith keepeth the ſoule without withering, and
<pb facs="tcp:11855:5"/> faith without periſhing: not but that a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like may leeſe his faith, but with greater dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie and more exceſſe of malice: as it befell not long agoe to a perſon of no ſmall account in England, whom I had knowne in time paſt a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique, but then a proteſtant: by chaunce once falling in company with him, I demaunded how it fared with him in religion: if he had forſaken that faith vtterly which he ſometime approued ſo feruently: forſaken quoth he, no faith, I am of opiinion, that he which once is thorowly grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Catholique religion, can not poſſibly but with extreme malignitie alter his religion: wel he may change it in ſhew, wel he may maske it with proteſtancie, wel he may varie his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but his iudgement, his conceit, his faith, hardly wil he change or neuer: and therefore by Gods grace, after I haue diſpatched ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires; I wil renounce the externall profeſſion, of that religion I knowe falſe and deteſt internally: but before his affaires were diſpatched, death had diſpatched him, that others may learn what it is to dally with GOD in matters of ſaluation.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong Catholikes, I knowe it were ſuperfluous, to indeuour with large diſcourſes, to proue this Queſtion: Becauſe, rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their iudgements vpon the Catholike Church, whoſe definition in all ages hath beene moſt manifeſt, they need no other proofe or demonſtration, Yet, partly to comforte them, partely to confirme that faith they haue embraced, I thinke ir not amiſſe, with ſome few ſimilitudes, or pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable experiences, to open alitle the vaile of this Arke, and diſcouer ſome ſecretes, which either ſeeme impoſsible, or inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable, imitating herein the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which explicate the myſteries of the Trinitie, Incarnation, Reſurrection, and others, with corporall ſimilitudes, and
<pb facs="tcp:11855:10"/> examples: yea Chriſt himſelf ſcarſe ſpoke but in Parables, now comparing grace to <note place="margin">Io. 4. &amp; 7. Mat. 13. Mat, 25.</note> water, now his church to a net, nowe the faithfull to fiue wiſe, and fiue fooliſh Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins; and the reaſon heere of I take to be the blindeneſſe of our wittes and dulneſſe of our capacities, who are not able to com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>prehend any ſpirituall myſteries without ſom corporal reſemblances, as moſt plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeareth in the Sacrament of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Trinitie, which cannot be vnderſtood in it ſelfe, but in ſome effects, euen as wee cannot beholde the Sunne in his ſpheare, but in the water, or thorow ſome cloude. Knitting therfore the iugement of Chriſt his church, the decrees of Councils, the conſent of Fathers, the reportes of Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the practiſe and vſe of al chriſtianity, I think that any man, not bewitched with wilfulnes, and but of an indifferent iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and capacitie, might eaſily diſcerne the veritie of this eſſential poynt of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie: For ſuppoſing here (that no man but ſenſleſſe can deny) that God was, and is able to effect this myſterie, and (as the learnedeſt Proteſtants haue confeſſed to me) with what words more plainly could he expreſſe his minde, hauing bread in his
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:11855:10"/> hand, than by ſaying, This is my bodie that ſhall bee giuen for you, This is my <note place="margin">Mat. 26. Marke 14. Luke 22. 1 Cor 11.</note> bloud which ſhal bee ſhed for you? Al E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſts with S. Paul conſpiring in the ſame wordes, in like ſenſe, neuer menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning trope or figure. And if euer Chriſt had occaſion to be plaine and apert in his ſpeach, queſtionleſſe heere where he gaue a Lawe, and enacted a Statute for his church. Who is ignorant that Laws ought to be perſpicuous, becauſe it is neceſſarie that al men ſhould know them? And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſee God gaue the Decalogue in ſo perſpicuous a maner. Here he inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">Exod. 20.</note> a Sacrament for his Church, but how plaine was hee in the inſtitution of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme? Here he ordained a principal cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie <note place="margin">Mat. 28.</note> of religion to be practiſed: &amp; who <note place="margin">Math. 13.</note> knows not how clearely he deliuered the ceremonial law to the Iewes in Leuiticus? Here he was priuate with his diſciples, to whome it was giuen to knowe myſteries, although to many others in Parables, and therefore it was conuenient, in plaine termes to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eueale this ſo profound a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie to them. Here finally Chriſt made his laſt wil and teſtament: al men confeſſe that willes muſt be moſt manifeſt, leſt the
<pb facs="tcp:11855:11"/> executors ſhould not agree about the ſenſe thereof. Therefore Chriſt giuing a law, inſtituting a ſacrament, appoynting a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ceremony, conuerſing priuately with his diſciples, and making his laſt will and teſtament, had ſufficient occaſion, I thinke, to conceiue through his infinite wiſedome, that here was no place for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphoricall figures, ſymbolicall ſenſes, or harſh ſpeeches ſubiect to ſundry interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. This reaſon conuiceth my wit, &amp; ſo perſwadeth my vnderſtanding, that ſuppoſing the thing poſsible, I maruell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man can deny it. And therefore ſince the venty of catholike religion is ſo true, certainely all arguments obiected againſt it, conſequently are conuinced to be falſe, whereunto followeth, that they may bee anſwered, as in like maner we affirme all arguments which can bee vttered againſt the holy Trinity to be Paralogiſmes &amp; ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble. And for better intelligence, and more fuller conceit, I meane to propound the chiefeſt, and rather anſwer them with naturall ſimilitudes, or other ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall myſteries, then ſeriouſly aſſoile them according to the principles of Diuinitie, where of moſt readers are not capable.</p>

               <p>Firſt, ſome will demand, how is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that ſuch a great bodie, as that of Chriſts, with al parts and members, ſhuld be cowched or conueied vnder ſo little an hoaſt, vnder a crumme of bread, or a drop of wine? I demaund before I anſwer, if it were not as great a myracle, for to make a church or mountaine enter into a hole no greater than a barley corne? No man can doubt of it: but this I will ſhew you done by nature.</p>
               <p>Go to the toppe of Paules ſteeple, and there view the country about, the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, hilles, plaines, valleis, the riuers, the gardeins, meddowes, orchardes, chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, houſes, beaſts, and men, heauen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, and earth beneath: now after ſuch a mightie proſpect, ſhut your eies, and in your mind you ſhall ſee all within, which before you ſaw without, in the ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſituation, correſpondence, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.

The reaſon is,

This ſame ſimilitude moſt aptly declareth the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of Chriſts bodie in the ſacrament, becauſe it receiueth a certaine ſpirituall garment, that maketh it to bee in euerie parte of the hoaſt, as the image of the mountaine repreſenteth the whole moun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine in euerie mans eie without confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or imptoportion. I demaund whether <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is more myraculous, to make a man with all his limmes to bee placed in no greater roome than a needles point, or a thing, which of it ſelfe is leſſe than a needles point, without anie addition of ſubſtance, to be dilated as much as a man? The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we ſee daily, why then do we wonder ſo much at the former? The ſoule of man requireth no place, but of it ſelfe fully and perfitly can refide in leſſe than a needles point: yet we ſee it dilated and ſpiritually extended as faire as the bodie. Yea God himſelfe filleth al places, whoſe entire &amp; compleate ſubſtance requireth no place,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:11855:12"/> but wholy may refide in one indiuiſible point.</p>
               <p>Is not the higheſt heauen the vaſteſt bodie, and the mightieſt maſſe that euer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> God created? and yet according to the moſt accepted opinion in the ſchooles of Philoſophers it inhabiteth no place.</p>
               <p>If God by his omnipotencie coulde <note place="margin">4 Mat. 9.</note> make a CAmmell paſſe through a needles eie, who wil denie but that he can put, by the ſame omnipotencie, the bodie of Chriſt in a little hoaſt?

               <p>

               <p>I anſwer: how is my ſoule whole in my head, whole in my handes, &amp; whole in my feete? If then one ſoule may bee intire in three places, there is no repugnance vvhy one body may not be in diuers places; for the repugnaunce is alike in both. If you ſay, the ſoule hath a certain connexion, or continuation in the bodie, which Chriſtes body hath not in ſuch diſtant places, this auaileth not: For who can proue, or euer did proue, that it is impoſsible for God to cut off my arme, and keepe my ſoule in it, and transfer it into Fraunce or Italie, leau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame ſoule in my body here in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland?</p>
               <p>We heare the Preacher in the Pulpit, whoſe voyce is but one, yet fiue hundred receiue it, and euery one the ſame ſound in his eare.</p>

               <p>Thirdly how can can the body and bloud of Chriſt, being ſo little in compariſon, be reſident in ſo many hoaſts and buttes of wine which in all the world are conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and reſerued in the tabernacle at one time?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>So.</hi> Do we not proue by daily experience how a little ſtorax or frankenſence, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into ſmoke keeping the ſame matter and quantitie only by rarefaction to bee ſufficient to fill a whole church? beſides, thoſe that vſe to worke quickſiluer proue moſt palpably, how this mettal being ſet vpon a fire in a pot aſſendeth al in ſmoke, and filleth a moſt large roome, yet after with external colde being congealed, the ſelfe ſame quicke-ſiluer falleth downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and is brought to a very ſmall quantitie.

               <p>Fourthly how can thoſe accidents, that whitenes, that quantitie, that moyſtnes, that dryneſſe, hang in the aire without their ſubſtance, as a houſe ſuſtained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any foundation, the rinde without the choare.</p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:11855:15"/> of this internall mutation?</p>
               <p>Senſible miracles and ſignes were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, eſpecially by God, for the conuerſion of infidels, and therfore were not effected ſo often among Chriſtians after they had receiued the faith: for as S.

               <p>Sixtly, how is not the body of Chriſt conſumed by ſo many, who daily ſince the firſt inſtitution, for ſo manie yeeres haue eaten him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pro.</hi> Chriſt, to occurre and anſwere this reaſon in the 6. chapt. of Saint Iohn, firſt wrought the wonderfull miracle by feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 5000. men, beſides women, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with fiue barly loaues, and two fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, with the aduantage of twelue baskets: I ſay he wrought this myracle before hee beganne to deliuer them the myſterie of this Sacrament, thereby to prepare themſelues to anſwere this Obiection:
<pb facs="tcp:11855:16"/> that if with ſo little he could feed ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and make ſo much remaine more then he receiued at the beginning, how can he notfeed millions, with his body, and yet preſerue it as entire as it was, when he firſt gaue it? Chriſts body doth no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe heere then oure ſoules doe euerye day in our bodies, becauſe as bodies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually exhale forth ſome partes, the which wee reſtore againe by meate and drinke: theſe parts dayly thus exhaled, our ſoules ceaſe to informe, and yet they neuer conſume nor deminiſh, euen ſo Chriſts body reſiding in diuers hoaſts, ceaſeth to bee in them leſing thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces without any other conſumtion or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration.</p>
               <p>Wee ſee the ſunne ſo many yeres hath euery daye brought newe light to the world, euery minut he changeth his place without defect or conſumption. And why ſhal not the Sunne of Iuſtice lighten the worlde in this Sacrament, and yet change euery minute his place without corruption or decay?</p>
               <p>Seauenthly how can he abide to paſſe into ſuch vndece<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t places, as mens ſtomaks whoſe breaths many ſcarſe can tolerat?
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:11855:16"/> 
                  <hi>Pro.</hi> How doth his diuinitie fil al places how vndecent and vncleane ſoeuer, rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no infection by them: but as the ſun beames beating vppon a dunghil, neither are infected nor defiled, in like manner the body of Chriſt adorned with the beames of immortalitie and impaſſibility, receaueth no impresſion of any infectious or noyſome creature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So.</hi> The ſtinch of ſin much more annoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſmell of his ſoule, when he conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in earth among ſinners than this could moleſt his body, and yet it was not vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent he ſhould ſuffer that, but a ſigne of extreme loue and mercy, ſo it is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly his body ſhould bee where thoſe defects be, ſuffering nothing but onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining there to worke moſt admirable effects in his creatures, to their great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and his exceeding charitie, as ſhall hereafter be declared.</p>
               <p>Eightly what becometh of the body of Chriſt, after the formes of bread and wine are corrupted? aſſendeth it to heauen? the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is it continually in voiage. Doth it ſtay in the ſtomacke? but that is moſt vndecent.</p>
               <p>When a mans arme is cut off, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth of his ſoule that informed that
<pb facs="tcp:11855:17"/> arme? doth it periſh? then he that lacketh an arme, lacketh a piece of his ſoule. Doth it hang in the aire? But the aire is not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized to receiue the information: fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, it ceaſeth to inform the arme, it lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that ſubiect and place, keeping the place in the bodie where it was before: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo the bodie of Chriſt leeſeth the place it had in the ſtomacke, and keepeth the place it had before in heauen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So.</hi> As the Sunne in a moment ſpreadeth his beames from Eaſt to VVeaſt, euen ſo Chriſt, his body from heauen into the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: and as if a clond hinder the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Sunne, the light ceaſeth, the Sunne remaineth where it was: euen ſo, when the forms of bread and wine periſh, Chriſts bodie ceaſeth to bee there, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in heauen, as he was before.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, when the Hoaſt is broken, how is not the bodie of Chriſt broken al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo? why are not ſeperated the legges from the body, &amp;c? why heare we no crackling of bones? why ſee we no effuſion of blod? <hi>Pro.</hi> When a looking glaſſe is broken, do you not ſee in both the peeces your face as entire as when it was whole? euen ſo,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:11855:17"/> when the hoaſt is broken, in both partes thereof remaineth the bodie of Chriſt as entire as it was in the whole.</p>

               <p>Tenthly, how can Chriſts body be in the Sacrament without confuſion, beeing whole coarcted into ſo little a place, for it ſeemes that al his bodie ſhould be preſſed to nothing?</p>
               <p>

               <p>Beſides, conſider how many wonderfull workes wee daily prooue effected, which we would haue iudged impoſsible before we ſee them, as in a geographicall glaſſe, the compas, and ſuch like.

               <p>Laſtly, not onely heretikes, but alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels exclaime againſt Catholiques, that it is a thing, not only vndecent and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to eate mans fleſh, &amp; drinke his bloud, but alſo impious and irreligious to eate their God, for what, ſay they, is more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:11855:18"/> then for God to abaſe himſelfe to be eaten, and more abhominable then for his creatures prophanely to deuoure him?</p>
               <p>This obiection might as wel bee made againſt Chriſtes incarnation, death, and paſsion, for it ſeemeth as vndecent for God to lie in a womans wombe for nine moneths, for him that is life it ſelfe to die, as to be eaten in this Sacrament: for what need had he of his creatures that he ſhuld toile ſo much for them? why could he not haue forgiuen them all their offences of his owne accorde, ſeeing the fault was committed againſt him? But the wiſdom of GOD ouer-reached theſe carnall and cloudie conceited men, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined meanes ſurpaſsing all vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings and deuiſes.

                  <p>The cauſe why this Sacrament ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth good ſoules againſt the wicked aſſaults of the world, I take to be the great abundance of charitie and grace, whch Chriſt offereth to thoſe that receiue his body worthily: for (as after ſhall be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) heere our Sauiour oepneth his hand, &amp; diſperſeth his heauenly treaſures moſt copiouſly. This celeſtiall dew, or rather this ſupernaturall flame ſo kindleth the hearts of all good ſoules, that it cauſeth them to loue, prize, and eſteeme God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, and conſequently to deſire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, than to haue occaſion to com to that ſupreame and heroicall act of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, <hi>Ponere animam pro amico ſuo,</hi> to <note place="margin">10. 15.</note> yeeld his life for his friend: For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they aſſuredly know they ſhal be like vnto him whome they doe claſpe in their breaſts: they wel vnderſtand, that loue more appeereth by ſuffering euil for their friend, than in dooing good for him. And for this cauſe I would councel, yea, and I am perſwaded, if the precept, of receiuing the Euchariſt bindeth out of Eaſter (as commonly Diuines holde it doth) that ſpecially thoſe, who eyther are to be examined or arraigned, or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all the reſt? Diuers cauſes I think may be rendred.

Secondly, becauſe in this Sacrament men partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate, not onely the life of grace in the ſoule, but alſo the body and ſoule folde within them the reall and ſubſtantial life of Chriſt, wherwith they are made one thing, one bodye, one life, wherefore Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Qui manducat me viuet propter me,</hi> He that eateth me, ſhall alſo liue by <note place="margin">Io. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thirdly, for that we here receaue the intire and compleate cauſe of life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting both of body &amp; ſoule, the which wee doe not in other Sacramentes, and therefore Chriſt ſaide, <hi>Qui manducat me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>

                  <p>Prieſt, Sacrifice, Religion, are ſo linked together that it is impoſible to finde one without the other: for there can be no Prieſt that hath no ſacrifice, nor any <note place="margin">Heb. 5.</note> religion where there is not both Prieſt and ſacrifice.

For the better vnderſtanding
<pb facs="tcp:11855:47"/> hereof it is to be noted, that in all ages, and in all nations, and in all religions, they euer vſed ſome ſorte of Sacrifices: for if wee looke into the lawe of nature wee ſhall finde, Abell, Abraham, Iob, offering vp ſacrifices: if wee diſcend to the law written, there will appeare an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable number appointed in Leuiticus. If wee come to Chriſt in his laſt ſupper, and vppon the Croſſe we ſhall finde him ſacrificing. Beſides, wee may obſerue that all their ſacrifices almoſt conſiſted in killing beaſts, or in the deſtruction of ſome creature, as in burning inſence or ſuch like.

Three reaſons then may bee yeelded: the firſt, becauſe by ſacrifices men acknowledge GOD the firſt maker, conſeruer, and laſt
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:11855:47"/> end of all creatures, the which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to profeſſe by the externall action of ſacrificing, becauſe in killing an oxe, and burning of him to aſhes, they depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued themſelues of all vſe of all profit, whereby they ſignified that all was due to him of whom they had receiued all. The ſecond reaſon was, becauſe the holy ghoſt moued them to vſe ſuch bloudie ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices to prefigurat the paſſion of chriſt once to be offerred vp on the Croſſe. Thirdly to ſhew by the death of beaſts, &amp; that they deſerued death for their ſins, that they offered the one to God in lieu of the other. By theſe three reaſons, wee plainly ſee, that wee in the lawe of grace haue as great need of a reall and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſacrifice, as either the Iewes, or thoſe that liued vnder the lawe of nature, For need not wee as well as they to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the dominion and right of GOD ouer this worlde? is not hee our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, our conſeruer, our laſt end, as well as theirs? ought not wee as well to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the ſacrifice of Chriſts paſsion paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as they to prefigurat that which was to come? do not our ſins, as well deſerue death as theirs did? and are not we bound
<pb facs="tcp:11855:48"/> as well to craue pardon for them as they? for theſe three cauſes therefore, and many more, our Sauiour inſtituted this ſacrifice of the altar: where by the incruent death of Chriſt we acknowledge the eternall dominion of God, and render him infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite thankes for all his gifts, as well of grace, as of nature, and therefore princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally it is called <hi>Euchariſtia,</hi> that is, <hi>grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arum actio,</hi> thankeſgiuing: beſides, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent moſt liuely his paſsion according to that precept of Chriſt, <hi>Hoc facite in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is a receued opinion among al learned diuines that the words of conſecrating, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum</hi> This is my body, do effect that they ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, that as God by ſaying, <hi>Fiat lux,</hi> let light be, made light, ſo by ſaying, <hi>Hoc est corpus meum,</hi> This is my body, is preſently put the bodie of Chriſt vnder the forme of bread: moreouer, that they effect no more imediatly than that they ſignifie, therfore by the vertue or efficacie of conſecrating imediatly there is only the body of Chriſt in the hoaſt without any ſoule: true it is, that there is no hoſt that hath not the ſoul of Chriſt, but that is not by the imediate force and vertue of conſecration, but by ſequele, by a following, or as they call it, <hi>per concommitantiam,</hi> becauſe the ſoule is ioyned with the body in heauen, therfore conſequently the body bringeth the ſoule with it, but if the ſoule were not in the bo

As for example, the woman of Samaria that drew <note place="margin">Io. 4</note> vp water with a cord from the wel, ſhe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly drew the cord, but by ſequele came the paile, becauſe it was tied to the corde, and with the paile, by ſequele the

But finally knowing that there was no meate, either more pleaſant for taſte, or profitable for health, or of more force, &amp; efficacie then himſelfe, he ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore propounded himſelfe as the obiect of our meditation, and the ſubiect of our

We know the cauſes of Adams ſin were theſe: the ſerpent, that is the wicked Angel, the woman, Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:11855:60"/> the tree of good &amp; ill, with the fruit therof, and finally, the deſire to be made like vnto God. Which al ſixe our Sauior hath matched, anſwerd, &amp; moſt diuinely oppoſed ſix like in our iuſtification. An Angell Gabriell to denounce Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, A Virgin to make her maker, Chriſt a man by nature &amp; wiſdome in his mothers womb, the tree of good &amp; il, the croſſe of chriſt where al the world might know the immenſiue goodnes of Chriſt who died for vs, and the peſtilent poiſon of ſinne that cauſed an innocent to die ſo cruelly, the fruit is this bleſſed ſacrament that bloſſomed out of Chriſts fide vpon the croſſe: finally, the deſire of deitie and immortalitie, proper effects of this ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the which intice all good chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to receiue it. By this plainly appeareth the conformitie of our reprobation, with the cauſes of our perdition. That euen as the ſcorpion carieth a ſting to poyſon &amp; a iuice to heale, ſo a tree yeeldeth a fruite of death, and a tree yeeldeth a fruit of life. But were it not an horrible abuſe to conuert this bread of life, into bread of death, and make that a poyſon, which was ordained to bee a remedye
<pb facs="tcp:11855:61"/> againſt poiſon. I am afraide that many had better haue ſwallowed poiſon then eaten this ſacrament: for poiſon in fine had but killed the body, and this killeth the ſoule. All thoſe who come not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, who iudge not the body of Chriſt from other prophane meates, theſe kill their owne ſoules. Many, as S. Ciprian <note place="margin">Cip. de caen Domini.</note> ſaith, <hi>Lambunt quidem petram, ſedinde nec mel ſugunt, nec oleum,</hi> They licke indeede the rocke, but thereof they ſuck neither hony nor oyle. And after hee addeth, <hi>Quibus expedit ſuſpendatur mola aſinaria in collo eorum, &amp; demergantur in profundum maris,</hi> To whome it is expedient that a milſtone were hanged about their necks, and that they were drownd in the depth of the ſea. But who be theſe? Thoſe <note place="margin">Matth. 18 Marke 9.

For this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by a natural propoſition ſuppoſeth the receiuer to liue ſpiritually. For a deade body cannot digeſt meate or nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh it ſelfe. And therfore he that is not
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:11855:61"/> in charity, offendeth hainouſly, by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing this ſacrament, haling (as S.

But this admirable operation of the Euchariſt, was not onely regiſtred in the olde Teſtament, but alſo
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:11855:75"/> expreſly proued in the new, and heare ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed indeede, that there was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolde in figure, when Chriſt the light of the worlde of ſet purpoſe fained himſelf a pilgrime, to inſtruct the twoo wandering pilgrimes in faith, the veritie of his death. <note place="margin">Luke 34</note> paſsion, and reſurrection: afterwardes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to drawe awaye the thicke vaile which hindered them for knowing whom he was, although in his talke their heartes <note place="margin">So S.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:11855:76"/> howe great a conqueſt they had made, what cities, what prouinces they had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, what great good did redound to their common-weale: the Senate vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this good ſucceſſe, prepared waies for him to paſſe, adorned Gates wherein he was to enter, addreſſed Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots to conduct him and his traine, hanged their ſtreets with tapiſtrie of arras, veluet, gold, and cloth of tiſſue.

The like (it ſeemes) befalleth in the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of Chriſt, in his Chariot of the Croſſe: for before his comming, al the old Teſtament was nothing elſe but a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, letters ſent by God to thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by <hi>Moſes,</hi> by prophets, by patriarches, to diſpoſe them to beleeue, expect, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire the day of this triumph, inſomuch, that ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wiſhed the heauens bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that hee might diſcend, loathing to ſtay any longer, he prepared his way with giuing a law and ceremonies, hee decked the ſtreetes with ſacraments and ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he adorned the gates, I meane his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb facs="tcp:11855:77"/> with infinite varietie of furniture, of cherubins, of lions, of floures. After Chriſt came into this life, hee marched for three <note place="margin">Matth. 21.

                     <pb facs="tcp:11855:91"/>
                     <p>It is a moſt auncient and vndoubted trueth, that all giftes which God beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon the worlde, for the vniuerſall or particular good of men, proceeded from the inexhauſted fountaine of his loue. For which cauſe the blinded Philoſophers could ſay that loue created this world. For what is loue? to wiſh wel to one, to reioice in his good, to procure his good, to defend him from euil, to communicate vnto him his treaſures, to make him partaker of his ſecrets. Al theſe actions, either be loue it ſelfe, or ſuch effects and fruites as can not be ſeparated from loue. Therefore if god freely of his owne accord, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt for our good, graunted vs ſo great a gift, who can doubt but that it ſpringeth from loue? Moreouer, his intention in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing diſcouereth ſufficiently the grounde of his gift: For what cauſe gaue he it? To vnite vs together with him. And for what end this vnion? That he ſeeing himſelfe ſealed in vs, might haue a ſufficient and worthy obiect of his loue; and wee ſeeing the ſame engrauen in him for a mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reſemblaunce, might bee inflamed to affect him. For what cauſe gaue he it? To imprint our ſoules with the life of grace.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:11855:91"/> And why? that he might loue vs, and wee him, for theſe be the proper effectes and fruits of grace. For what cauſe gaue he it? To be a means to obtain life euerlaſting. And why life euerlaſting? That there we might with the full power of our heartes exerciſe that loue &amp; charity <hi>quae nunquam</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1. Corint. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>excidit,</hi> which neuer falleth away, that there the ſailes of loue might ſwell with the full winde of the holy ghoſt. Finally, diſcourſe ouer all thoſe cauſes wee haue alleadged. you ſhall finde them euery one grounded in loue.

The fruits of loue be theſe, vnion, zeale, extaſie bountifulnes.

                     <p>All perfect loue requireth a certaine <note place="margin">Vaion.</note> vnion in ſubſtance, as was declared in the eight cauſe: but for that amongeſt men this was vnpoſsible without the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one or both, therefore they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured all theſe vnions, which honeſty &amp; puritie of loue affect, and theſe are to be of the ſame iudgements and opinions, the ſame wills, deſires, and affections, the ſame table and diet, the ſame place and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, the like garments and attire, and finally, to expreſſe one another in all things as neere as they can.</p>

But what would they haue inferred if they had ſeene chriſtians cate their God? Queſtionleſſe they might much more euidently haue confirmed their opinion. For when I thorowly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with my ſelfe that god could die for man: and befides, would giue himſelfe to him for meate, me thinkes if I had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter to meditate vpon all my life, this woulde ſerue men, by weighing the weaknes, miſeries, and infirmities of men: and after, comparing them with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of God: and then to ſee that God would make ſuch an account of man, that hee would debaſe himſelfe almoſt to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for his loue. This I ſay might cauſe the Seraphins to veile their eyes for won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and mortall men to be rauiſhed with admiration. If a friend doe ſpend but his goods for his friend, ſo that of a rich man he becom a beggar, who would not think this loue exceeding?

The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience is manifeſt in luke warme water, in boyling water, and in a gloing iron, all which participate heat: but becauſe wee perceiue that one heateth more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently then another, wee doe conclude, that they all are hot, yet exceeding one another in degree of heate. Moſt true it is, that all ſupernatural gifts which proceed from God, and are imparted to men, iſſue from an infinite power, wiſdome, and goodnes, becauſe they cannot be effected but by God: yet this conſiſteth rather in the manner of their production, then in their ſubſtance or degree of perfection: as for example, Chriſt changed water into <note place="margin">Iohn 2.</note>
                           <pb facs="tcp:11855:113"/> wine in the mariage, the manner of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this miacle in an inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with a word, without the helpe or concourſe of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe, required infinite power: yet becauſe the ſubſtance of wine, the degree and perfection of wine, was limitted and contained within the boundes of a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all creature, therfore it required no infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of cauſe or principle, and therefore we ſee a vine can produce wine: But if God could create an angel of infinit ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, perfection, or grace, then, not only the manner, but alſo the ſubſtance would exact the infinit power of God. By this diſcourſe we may plainly conceiue, that this gift which GOD hath beſtowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon vs, requireth, not only infinit power in the manner of producing it vnder the rindes of bread and wine, but alſo in the very degree and perfection: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, being a gift, proceedeth from no limitred, but infinit loue in degree and perfection, becauſe, the effects being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit in degree, argueth a principle in like proportion, and therfore we may wel con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clude, that this gift and Gods loue weyed both in a ballance haue not one dram of difference. What loue can equall this?

But if we adde here vnto the value of this loue, the dignitie and worth, the vehemencie therof would better appeare. For as one droppe of Chriſts bloud in this ſacrifice ought more to be prized then millions of worldes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo one graine of this loue ought to be preferred before all the loues that euer were, are, or ſhalbe.

Who ſees not that the hoaſt offered is without ſpot of imperfection, or wrinckle of old age, either in diuinitie or humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, in qualities of bodie, or operations of ſoule. Secondly, this Lambe was to bee ſacrificed in the Citie of Ieruſalem, and where can this ſacrifice be offered, but in the Catholike church, by Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented? Thirdly, it was to be ſacrificed in the euening: at what time elſe appointed our ſauiour this ſacrament? When did hee eate it with his diſciples, but in the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? All the whole family were to meete at this feaſt, to be made partakers thereof: by this we vnderſtand the charitie that all Catholikes ought to haue, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they come to this altar to eate the common foment of all true charitie. Fiftly, it was to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten roſted, and ſo was our bleſſed ſauiour vpon the croſſe, and in his ſacrament, with the fire of charity, which he brought from heauen to earth, and what elſe pretended he but that it ſhoulde burne. Sixtly, no common bread, but vnleauened was to be
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:11855:131"/> eaten in this ſacred feaſt: Ioyne this bread and the lamb together, and loe the formes of our vnleauened ſacrifice, &amp; our lambe of God that taketh away the ſinnes of the world. Beſides, this vnleauened bread ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth innocencie &amp; ſinceritie, that none ought to feede here but ſuch as think ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily they bee in Gods grace, and cloathed with the marriage garment of eternall ſanctitie.

Eightly, the head, the feet, and the intrals were to be ſwallowed, that is, in this ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as was declared in the 41. cauſe) the diuinitie of Chriſt fignified by his head, the loue of Chriſt declared by his feete, the ſecret manner of his being heere we muſt ſwallow, no mortall man can ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently comprehend them.

Tenthly they holde

            <head>An aduiſe for proteſtants and puritanes.</head>
            <p>IF ſo it chance that theſe my ſimple diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes fall into their hands for whoſe taſtes they were not prepared, I thought good to giue them three or foure aduir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſments, that they remaining without the vineyard of Chriſt, may thruſt their hands through the hedge, and benefit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues at leaſt by the leaues of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, ſince they cannot be pertakers of the fruite.</p>
            <p>Firſt that I inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded not here to proue by fathers, councells, &amp; ſcriptures, theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, euery cauſe as in ſchooles they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are handled: (the which if I were to deale with heretikes, I could eaſily performe) but only briefly to repreſent vnto the peoples eyes for their meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſome pointes appliable to euery ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes capacitie. Neither doe I ſtuffe the margines with ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ations, becauſe in very deed I lacked bookes: but euery found diuine may wel perceiue, that what ſoeuer the fathers haue written concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the inſtitution and effects of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt,
<pb facs="tcp:11855:133"/> may be reduced into one cauſe or other. And conſequently a little reading would quickly haue filled the margines.</p>
            <p>Secondly, let them conſider how maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically, how reuerently, how reaſonably Catholikes belieue, téach, and worſhippe this ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And what difference there is betwixt our venerable ſacrifice, &amp; their prophane bread and wine. Our ſacrament ſubſiſting by Gods ſonne incarnate, and their meere tipicall ſhadowe: our euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting fountaine, ſpringing graces and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, for life euelaſting, and their naked ſupper, vnſeaſoned with grace, depriued of vertue, ſpoiled of religion. And in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry truth, I cannot ſee how they can ſaue it, but that whoſoeuer eateth his breakefaſt ſaying grace before and after, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth as well, and feedeth as perfectly on Chriſt by faith as they do. Moreouer who is ſo blind that cannot diſcerne howe the paſcall lambe and manna, which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented Chriſt in the holy Euchariſt, were much more excellent ſacraments then their communion, becauſe they more liuely repreſented Chriſt, the lambe his paſsion, and manna the fruites thereof, then a gobbet of bread and a ſup of wine:
<pb facs="tcp:11855:134"/> and conſequently the blood of the lambe ſprinckled vpon their dores, much more expreſly ſtirred Vp their faith to feed on Chriſt then a breakfaſt of bread &amp; wine.</p>
            <p>Thirdly for this argument and many more I find the proteſtants both in their bookes and conferences moſt waue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing, and not able finally to reſolue themſelues what to hold, yet I heare that Doctour <hi>Andrewes</hi> hath publikely preached that Chriſts bodie is there really, and manie Proteſtants I know hold the ſame opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But alas how is it poſsible for any man to eate the bodie of Chriſt really, and not corporally, after the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>er of Catholikes, defend the bodie of Chriſt to be really in the ſacrament? for howe can it be reallie preſent, being really diſtants as far as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen from earth? or how can the body haue a reall preſence and a corporall abſence? it is euen as much to ſay, as a man may eate really a Capon, and yet none of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a Capon, which is not intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and they themſelues know not what they ſay, but fal into manifold abſurdities and contradictions: for as many as write of their eating of Chriſt by faith, differ from others in declaring, how he is eaten
<pb facs="tcp:11855:134"/> by faith, and in diſtinguiſhing their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion from a good chriſtian breakfaſt.</p>
            <p>Laſtly let them conſider of what a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure they are depriued, for it ſeemeth in verie deede that God in puniſhment of their errors would abandon them, and leaue them deſtitute of one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt benefits he beſtowed vpon mankind. Alas by lacking this light, they liue in darkeneſſe, by wanting this cloude to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire them from the ſcorching flames of concupiſcence, it is no maruaile if they cannot liue chaſtly, being ſpoyled of this ſinew of charity, it is no wonder if diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion raigne among them, hauing ſent into exile theſe bowels of mercie, for neceſsity chriſtian charitie fayleth: abandoning the only ſacrifice of true religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: conſeqne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly they haue expelled al true deuotion. And therefore wee now proue by experience in England, that faſting is left, praying lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle accounted, mortification reiected, almes brought to nothing, virginity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, Chriſtian pietie deemed hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and in ſine, for lacke of this ſacrament and true religion brought in fleſhly prudence and Atheiſme.</p>
